# Statics VS Dynamic Arrays 

## Statics (Default Array)
Statics its are fixed in size (you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time).

0 -> juice
1 -> apple
2 -> cheese 
...

operations:
* lookup
* push
* insert
* delete

## Dynamics Arrays

Allow us to copy and rebuild an array at a new location, which with more memory.

Operations:
* lookup O(1)
* append* O(1)
* insert O(n)
* delete O(n)

*can be O(n)*
